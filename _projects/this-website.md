## Presentation
This project was realised in 2022 when I decided to replace the old WordPress one that was ageing. I wanted to create a place that could be a portfolio for professional purposes and where I could experiment with things and make them available online (try technologies like 3D/VR or any technology that could fit on a website).

I wanted something simple enough to have results quickly after I started to develop but with enough flexibility to add custom features and designs. I also wanted something easily hostable.
After trying several backend and frontend solutions (Gatsby.js, Nuxt.js, Grav + Contentful), I finally chose Jekyll as it can be easily hosted (and for free) on Github with Github Pages, and it has all the characteristics that I sought.
