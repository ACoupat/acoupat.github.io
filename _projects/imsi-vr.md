## Context
This project has been realised during my last year of studies at UTBM. It is the result of a partnership between two UTBM departments : my department (Computer Science / INFO, two students) and the Industrial Systems department (IMSI, four students). 

On the INFO side our goal was to design and develop a project of our choice using a **Virtual Reality** technology. On the IMSI side, the team's goal was to promote their department by using a modern technology, while applying project management methods. Thus, our common goal was to develop an VR application that we could show during the UTBM open days, presenting different aspects of the IMSI department, that are usually not easy to show, as it would require to move a lot of industrial equipments.

This project was interresting because we not only had to focus on designing and developing our VR application. We also had to meet the IMSI department's requirements and understand their needs to provide a relevant experience for visitors.

## Project Description
For technical part, this project was built mostly using **Unity** as the 3D game engine and **Blender** for the 3D models. The target VR hardware was the **HTC Vive Headset**.

The final version of the app features several interactive activities that we defined during the conception phase :  
<ul>
<li>Starting in a changing room, the user has to find and equip Personal Protective Equipments (PPE)</li>
<li>Once it is done, the visitor is able to access the main part of the tour, which features :  
	<ul>
		<li>Interactive machine tools</li>
		<li>A space where the visitor can chose different videos displayed on a screen, by placing different items in an interactive area</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>If he/she has enough time, the visitor can be invited to go to another room which features  
	<ul>
		<li>An assembly bench where the visitor can assemble a stepper</li>
		<li>A leaderboard that displays the different assembly times accomplished by all the visitors of the day</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
