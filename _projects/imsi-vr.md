## Context
This project was realised during my last year of studies at UTBM. It results from a partnership between two UTBM departments: my department (Computer Science / INFO, two students) and the Industrial Systems department (IMSI, four students). 

On the INFO side, our goal was to design and develop a project of our choice using a **Virtual Reality** technology. On the IMSI side, the team's goal was to promote their department using modern technology while applying project management methods. Thus, our goal was to develop a VR application that we could show during the UTBM open days. The aim was to present various aspects of the IMSI department that are usually not easy to demonstrate, as it would require moving a lot of industrial equipment.

This project was interesting because we not only had to focus on designing and developing our VR application. We also had to meet the IMSI department's requirements and understand their needs to provide a relevant experience for visitors.

## Project Description
For the technical part, this project was built mostly using **Unity** as the 3D game engine and **Blender** for the 3D models. The target VR hardware was the **HTC Vive Headset**.

The final version of the app features several interactive activities that we defined during the conception phase :  
<ul>
<li>Starting in a changing room, the user has to find and equip Personal Protective Equipments (PPE)</li>
<li>Once it is done, the visitor is able to access the principal part of the tour, which features :  
	<ul>
		<li>Interactive machine tools</li>
		<li>A space where the visitor can chose different videos displayed on a screen by placing various items in an interactive area</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is enough time left, the visitor will be invited to continue to another room which features  
	<ul>
		<li>An assembly bench where the visitor can assemble a stepper</li>
		<li>A leaderboard that displays the different assembly times accomplished by all the visitors of the day</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
