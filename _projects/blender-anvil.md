## Presentation
This render was made by following Andrew Price's [great YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi87Dap_WOc&list=PLcpbyAte3x6Y0skyLUZEUKOlqcsFmPpHT) after I followed [the one about the Donut](/projects/blender-donut).  

I found this series when I was looking for a way to improve my 3D skills with **Blender**. It was a way to go deeper into various aspects like modelling (with a better understanding of topology), texturing and shading (ex : texture mixing in the Node Editor).
