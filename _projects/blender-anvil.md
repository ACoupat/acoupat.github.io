## Presentation
This video was made by following Andrew Price's [great YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi87Dap_WOc&list=PLcpbyAte3x6Y0skyLUZEUKOlqcsFmPpHT), after having followed [the one about the Donut](/projects/blender-donut).  

I found this series when I was looking for a way to improve my 3D skills with **Blender**. This was a way to go deeper in some aspects such as modeling (with a better understanding of topology) and texturing (mixing them with a shader).
