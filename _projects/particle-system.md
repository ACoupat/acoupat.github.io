## Context
This project has been realised during my last year of studies at UTBM. This course was an introduction to low-level 3D technologies such as OpenGL, and all the technical and mathematical aspects that they imply.

The goal of the project was to develop a particle system simulating a fire. This was the occasion to work with OpenGL shaders and put in practice mathematical concepts to recreate the behaviour of fire with for example, the random generation of ascending particles.

## Project Description
For technical part, this project was built mostly using **OpenGL** and **Qt** for the graphical interface, with the C++ language.

The final version of the application allowed to visualize the generated fire while acting on some properties through a graphical interface to modify the way it as rendered (base radius, color, textures, etc...)
