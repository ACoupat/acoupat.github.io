## Context
This project was realised during my last year of studies at UTBM. This course was about low-level 3D technologies such as OpenGL, and all the technical and mathematical aspects they imply.

The project's goal was to develop a particle system simulating a fire. It was the occasion to work with OpenGL shaders and use mathematical concepts to recreate the fire's behaviour with a random generation of ascending particles.
## Project Description
For technical part, this project was built with **OpenGL** and **Qt** for the graphical interface, with the C++ language.

The final version of the application allowed to view the generated fire while acting on some properties through a graphical interface to modify the way it as rendered (base radius, color, textures, etc...)
