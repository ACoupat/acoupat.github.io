## Presentation
Here is a simple test of **MeshRoom**, a photogrammetry software. From 40 pictures taken with a smartphone, the software could generate Ã  textured 3D model, needing just a little cleaning in Blender before beeing ready for the integration into a 3D scene (see the result in the viewer above).

To maximize the quality of the 3D reconstruction, I put the subject on top of playing cards with heterogeneous patterns that could easily be processed by the reconstruction algorithm. I also put some random objects around the subject to add more visual patterns. 

It seemed that the lighting of the whole scene is important and has to be homogeneous on all the pictures.
