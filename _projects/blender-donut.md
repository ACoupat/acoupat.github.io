## Presentation
This video was made by following Andrew Price's [great YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD).  

I found this series when I was looking for a way to improve my 3D skills with **Blender**. It has the great advantage to go through all the steps, from zero to the rendering of a video, passing by all the steps of a 3D production (modeling, texturing, shading, lighting, scene layout, rendering etc...)

The thing I liked the most is the use of the Blender feature called **"Geometry Nodes"** which introduces a more "programmatic" way of doing 3D modeling. This fits my computer science background very well.
