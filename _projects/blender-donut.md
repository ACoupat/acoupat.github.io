## Presentation
This video was made by following Andrew Price's [great YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD).  

I found this series looking for a way to improve my 3D skills with **Blender**. It has the great advantage of going through all the steps, from scratch to the rendering of a video, passing by all the stages of a 3D production (modeling, texturing, shading, lighting, scene layout, rendering etc…)

What I liked the most was using the Blender feature called **“Geometry Nodes”**, which introduces a more “programmatic” way of making 3D models. It is an interresting way to match my computer science background by thinking more in terms of algorithm.
