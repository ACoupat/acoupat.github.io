## Presentation
The last 6-months internship in the context of my IT engineering studies was done in MiddleVR, a company based in Paris specialized in VR solutions. This company was searated in two teams, the first one developing a VR collaboration tool and the second one developping  custom applications for various profesionnal sectors.

I was part of this second team and I had the opportunity to work on three different projects. The most significative one was the development of a demonstration application that could be used on trade shows and professional events. It consisted in a guided procedure to teach the user how to build an plane engine.
