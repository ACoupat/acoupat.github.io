## Presentation
The last 6-months internship in the context of my IT engineering studies was done in MiddleVR, a company based in Paris specialized in VR solutions. This company was searated in two teams, the first one developing a VR collaboration tool and the second one developping custom applications for various profesionnal sectors.

I was part of this second team and I had the opportunity to work on three different projects. The most significative one was called **EngineAssembly**, an application that could be used on trade shows and professional events yo demonstrate MiddleVR exepertise. It consisted in a guided procedure to teach the user how to build an plane engine.

On this project, originally started in collaboration with another intern, I had the opportunity to **design some user interactions** (with user experience in mind), to do **3D/VR development with Unity** and even some **3D modelling with Blender**.

Since I left the company this application was enhanced by the rest of the team (some graphical improvements were made by a 3D graphist, and some of the interactions have been improved as well)but the core application remains the same and is still demonstrated on some trade shows.
