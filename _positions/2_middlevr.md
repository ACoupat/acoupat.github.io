## Presentation
I did my the last 6-months internship of my IT engineering studies at MiddleVR, a company based in Paris which is specialized in VR solutions. This company was divided into two teams, the first one developing a VR collaboration tool and the second one developing custom applications for various professional sectors.

I was part of this second team, and had the opportunity to work on three different projects. The most significant one was called **EngineAssembly**, an application that could be used on trade shows and professional events to demonstrate MiddleVR expertise. It consisted of a guided procedure to teach the user how to build a plane engine.

On this project, originally started in collaboration with another intern, I had the opportunity to **design some user interactions** (with user experience in mind), to do **3D/VR development with Unity** and even some **3D modelling with Blender**.

After I left the company, the application was enhanced by the rest of the team. Some graphical improvements were made by a 3D graphist, and some of the interactions have been improved as well. However, the core application remains the same and is still demonstrated today on some trade shows.
