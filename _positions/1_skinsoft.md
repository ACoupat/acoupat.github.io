## Presentation
I previously worked at SKINsoft (based in Besan√ßon, France), a company designing and editing full-web applications dedicated to the management of the collections of museums and cultural institutions. From September 2021 to September 2022, I have been working remotely from Cork, Ireland.

During my working period at SKINsoft, I have had many opportunities to develop my technical and organizational skills through different missions.

## Missions 
- **Managing the development team** dedicated to the web portals used to publish the customers' collections on the internet. I applied some principles inspired by the **agile method SCRUM** (sprint management and planning, communication facilitation inside and outside the team, resources repartition etc...). I also took part in daily meetings and sprint retrospectives.
I took care of feature testing and validation before deployment and delivery to customers. I had to consider **user experience** and **responsive design** to deliver good quality products as much as possible.
