## Presentation
I am currently working at SKINsoft, a company based in Besan√ßon (France). It is specialized in full-web applications for collection management of museums and cultural institutions. Since September 2021, I work remotely from Cork, Ireland.

Since I began working at SKINsoft, I had many opportunities to develop my technical and organizational skills, through different missions.

## Missions 
- **Managing the development team** dedicated to the web portals used to publish the customers' collections on the internet. I apply some principles inspired by the **agile method SCRUM** (sprint management and planning, communication facilitation inside and outside the team, resources repartition etc...). I also take part in daily meetings and sprint retrospectives.
I also take care of feature testing and validation before deployment and delivery to customers. I take into account **user experience** and **responsive design** to deliver good quality products as mush as possible.
